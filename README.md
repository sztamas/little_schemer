Solutions from The Little Schemer book.


Typing in the functions every time author says "now write X".

Running them in racket.

```
~/.racketrc has

(require xrepl)
```

for extra capabilites.

Load file into the REPL with:

```
-> ,ld functions.rkt
```

Then run some examples against the functions as I write them:

```
-> (lat? '(1 2 3))
#t
```
